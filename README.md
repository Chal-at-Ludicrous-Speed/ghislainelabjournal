## Preparation:

1. Make sure R and R-studio are installed;
2. Make sure the `rmarkdown`-package is installed in R-studio (with "install dependencies");
3. Make sure [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) is installed and connected to your GitHub account;

## Cloning the repository:

1. Click the green 'Code'-button in the top right corner, and copy the web URL;
2. Clone the repository to your laptop using GitHub Desktop.

The local folders contains all of the files you need. All you need for it to work is (the latest version of) R and R-studio installed.

## Journal your work:

1. Navigate to the cloned folder and open the 'bigssslabjournal.Rproj' file. This should automatically open R-studio, and your current working environment will be inside this project.
2. Inside R-studio you should see a files tab in the bottom right hand corner; 
3. Customize the 'index.Rmd' as you wish within R-studio, to make it your own;
4. Journal your work by editing the 'journal.Rmd'-files.

You can keep your notes/working scripts in the /test-folder.

## Hosting on Github:

This repository has the capability of serving html-files contained in the repository (aka github pages).
In this repository, the webpage is built from the 'docs'-folder.

1. Recompile the lab journal website using the build function in the top right hand corner;
2. Push your changes to GitHub using GitHub Desktop.
3. Profit!
