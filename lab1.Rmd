## Literature and Research Questions 

Burris (2004) The Academic Caste System: Prestige Hierarchies in PhD Exchange Networks
- Academics gain social capital from their department (structure)
- Social capital can be combined with academic merit (e.g. research impact) (individual)
- Social capital alone has a much higher explanatory power than combined with academic merit

Hanneman (2001) The Prestige of Ph.D. Granting Departments of Sociology: A Simple Network Approach
- Prestige ranking as the behavioral realization of processes of social exchange

de Haan (2014) Sociology in the Netherlands
- Dutch Sociology departments have little differentiation

Descriptive: To what extent do Dutch sociology department differ in prestige?
Explanatory: To what extent do Dutch sociologists gain social capital and academic merit from their department?
